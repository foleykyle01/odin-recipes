            <h3>About the Soup:</h3>
                <p>I am a huge fan of this pasta recipe made with Tortellini and Italian Sausage. It also seems to be a crowd pleaser with my girlfriend as well who is quite the picky eater.</p>
                <p>This soup only requires one cooking tool, the humble <strong>Crockpot</strong> and requires only a few mins of attending cooking time.</p>
