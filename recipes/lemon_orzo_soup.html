        <h3>About the Soup:</h3>
            <p>The Lemon Chicken Orzo soup from this recipe is another hit with the girlfriend. This soup <br>is great in the dead of winter and in the ealry spring as it can be served both hot and warm</p>
            <p>This soup does not cook in a crock pot making the cooking a bit more involved but much less <br> time over all. The other benifit is that the recipe uses a rotissere chicken which is super easy!</p>

        <h3>Time to Make:</h3>
            <p>50 mins</p>
        <h3>Ingredents:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 sticks celery chopped finely</li>
                <li>2 medium carrots peeled & chopped finely</li>
                <li>1/2 medium onion chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
                <li>Box and a half of chicken broth</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>1 rotissere chicken</li>
                <li>1 cup uncooked orzo</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice or to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley or to taste</li>
                <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Saut√© the celery, carrots, and onions in a large soup pot with the butter and oil over medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, then add the flour and cook for another minute or so.</li>
                <li>Pour in chicken broth and stir until the flour has dissolved, then add the Italian seasoning and chicken. Bring the soup to a boil.</li>
                <li>Cover the soup (lid slightly ajar), and reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the orzo and cook for another 10 minutes or until the orzo is cooked through. I keep the lid off and stir it fairly often because it tends to stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken to the soup here. Also add the lemon juice (you may want to add more than I suggest - I didn't want to make the soup too lemony for some people), parsley, and season the soup with salt & pepper as needed. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spicy chicken broth is a must for this recipe, it really makes all the ingredients pop.</li>
                <li>Cream can be added at the end of the cook to make the soup a bit more creamy if that is what is desired</li>
            </ul>
